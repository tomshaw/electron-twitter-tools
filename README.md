## Overview

> Electron Twitter Tools a cross platfom [Electron](https://electronjs.org) application that allows users to effortlessly backup and restore user lists, seamlessly manage friends and followers, perform powerful multi account user searches and finally execute highly customized streaming searches that index a litany of data including languages used, geographic locations and rudimentary sentiment analysis. The project was originaly developed to learn the basics of [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en) but has evolved into much more. Thanks to Twitter's powerful programming API that offers developers the unique ability to develop exciting features not currently offered out of the box. At this time there is a feature freeze but much more functionalty is planned for the future.

## Build Setup
Once the application is launched you will need to provide your own Twitter API keys in the application configuration panel. An Sqlite3 database comes pre-selected and ready to use by default. If you wish to use an alternative storage solution [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/) currently supports Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift. At this time only Sqlite3 and MySQL have been tested. The system is designed to easily test the others and will be on a time permitting basis. A Google Maps API key is also required and can also be added in the application settings control panel.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build

# run unit & end-to-end tests
npm test

# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

```

## Features

Functionality you'll find in this application include:

- Completely manage user lists including backup and restore options.
- A robust customized streaming search that harvests a litany of data.
- A multi user account lookup that returns most of the relevant metadata. 
- The ability to completely delete user statuses based on search criteria.
- Supports multiple storage backends special thanks to [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/)

## Contributing
This project was developed to learn the basics of Electron and Vue.js and was developed rather hastily. Many of the components are incomplete or could use vast improvements. Any pull requests, suggestions or ideas to enhance the project are highly welcomed. Please read the contributing guide thoroughly before issuing pull requests.

## AFINN

This project makes use of [AFINN](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) a list of English words rated for valence with an integer between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive). The words have been manually labeled by Finn Ã…rup Nielsen in 2009-2011.
